(*
   getopt - the getopt() function parses the command-line arguments.
            Its arguments argc and argv are the argument count and array as
            passed to the main() function on program invocation.  An element of
            argv that starts with '-' (and is not exactly "-" or "--") is an
            option element.  The characters of this element (aside from the
            initial '-') are option characters.  If getopt() is called
            repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
            from each of the option elements.
*)

PROCEDURE getopt (argc: INTEGER; argv: ADDRESS; optstring: ADDRESS) : CHAR ;
